# pali-hotkeys
This AutoHotkey script lets you type all the Pali diacritics (and several extended letters) quickly using Alt, Shift, and Ctrl combinations. It is based on an earlier script by Ānandajoti Bhikkhu, expanded to include the extra characters I needed. For more Dhamma resources go to http://www.nibbida.com
